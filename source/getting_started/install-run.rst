Run |C| on IntelÂ® NUC
=====================

Prerequisites
-------------

The following hardware are required to proceed with the installation.

* |NUC| system - |C| has been validated on the following models:

    * |NUC| Kit `NUC7i5DNHE <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc/kits/nuc7i5dnhe.html>`_
    * |NUC| Kit `NUC7i5BNH <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc/kits/nuc7i5bnh.html>`_
    * |NUC| Kit `NUC6CAYH <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc/kits/nuc6cayh.html>`_

* A HDMI PC monitor display
* A USB keyboard and a USB mouse
* A 8GB USB flash drive
* A development PC workstation running 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Linux

Two types of installer images can be built from the |C| source repositories: if the firmware of your target system supports **UEFI Shell**, you can jump to the next section, `Install using Kernel Flinger executables`_ to automatically setup the |NUC| device with the Kernel Flinger UEFI executables. Or, proceed with the following section to install the system using interactive `GRUB <https://www.gnu.org/software/grub>`_ installer.

Install using GRUB installer image
----------------------------------

Prepare a |C| installer USB flash drive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have a |C| GRUB installer image, burn the installer image onto a USB flash drive. The USB flash drive will be used to bootstrap the |NUC| target device, format the disk partitions on the target device, and install |C| images to the disk partitions required by Android. You can use `Rufus <https://rufus.akeo.ie/>`_ or a similar tool to create a bootable USB drive on Windows. Alternatively, use the disk-dump command ``dd`` on any Linux system to create a |C| installer USB drive.

.. caution::
    *The following commands will format the USB flash drive, and destroy all its existing content. Backup your data before proceeding.*

Create |C| installer USB drive in Windows
.........................................

Download and install `Rufus <https://rufus.akeo.ie/>`_ utility if you do not have a similar tool to create bootable USB drives from image files. Launch the Rufus utility and click the CD icon on the tool panel to select the |C| installer image file in the pop up dialog box.

.. figure:: images/rufus.png

The Rufus utility is able to detect the presence of USB removable flash drives. After picking the image file in the `File Open` dialog box, click the *Start* button to flash the installer image to the USB drive.

Create |C| installer USB drive in Linux
.......................................

Open a terminal window and go to the directory that contains the GRUB installer image. Plug in a USB flash drive to the Linux workstation and identify the USB flash drive using the ``lsblk`` command. This command shows all drives attached to the Linux workstation, including the primary hard drive. Make sure the drive name is assigned to the USB removable drive, as passing an incorrect drive name to the ``dd`` command might cause the workstation to not boot up.

.. code-block:: bash
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    $ lsblk
    NAME           MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sdb              8:16   1  14.9G  0 disk
    +-sdb1           8:17   1   870M  0 part
    sda              8:0    0 238.5G  0 disk
    +-sda1           8:1    0    80G  0 lvm  /
    +-sda2           8:2    0   3.8G  0 part [SWAP]
    +-sda3           8:3    0   477M  0 part /boot/efi

In the previous example, **/dev/sdb** is assigned to the USB removable drive. This allows you to flash the installer image to the USB drive with the following commands, replacing the drive names with the actual device node observed from the previous ``lsblk`` command.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo dd if=celadon.img of=/dev/sdb bs=4K
    $ sync; sync; eject /dev/sdb

Install |C| to |NUC| using installer USB drive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. caution::
    *The primary hard drive of the Intel NUC will be completely wiped out. Backup your data before proceeding.*

Plug the bootable USB flash drive into a |NUC| device, power on the device, and press **F10** to instruct the device to boot from the USB drive.

Confirm to allow the installer to re-format the disk partitions on it. The installer will overwrite the disk partitions with |C| Android images.

Install using Kernel Flinger executables
----------------------------------------

Copy Kernel Flinger executables to a USB flash drive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Kernel Flinger installation approach does not require you to erase the content of the USB flash drive, but the USB flash drive needs to have at least a -2GB VFAT file system on it to store the Kernel Flinger UEFI executables. The Kernel Flinger executables are packaged in a .ZIP file, unzip the content of the .ZIP file to a USB flash drive before the installation.

Boot the built-in EFI Shell to bootstrap the installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Kernel Flinger executables are loaded and run by the **UEFI Shell**. To enable the built-in UEFI Shell in the UEFI firmware of |NUC|, power on the device and press **F2** to enter the firmware setup menu.

    :align: center

Click the *Advanced* button on the *Boot Order* pane, then click the *Boot Configuration* tab to ensure the Internal UEFI Shell option is checked in the *Boot Devices* list.

.. figure:: images/enable_uefi_shell.jpg
    :align: center

Save any modified configuration before rebooting the system, and press **F10** to enter the Boot Menu. Plug the USB flash drive with Kernel Flinger executables on it to any USB port, and select **UEFI: Built-in EFI Shell** to boot the NUC. After counting down, the UEFI Shell runs the ``startup.nsh`` script on the USB flash drive, and installs the Celadon images automatically.

Reboot to Android UI
--------------------

Once the installation is complete, the device re-boots automatically. However, |C| implements the Android `Verified Boot <https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/verified-boot>`_ mechanism developed by Google. We did not enroll any keys such as other commercial Android products do, so a KernelFlinger warning screen is displayed before showing the traditional Android booting screen.

The first boot of the device takes time to prepare the built-in apps. Be patient, the Android home screen will show after the system boots up.

In addition to the traditional Android UI launcher, |C| supports the experimental automotive UI launcher introduced in Android 9.0 Pie.
